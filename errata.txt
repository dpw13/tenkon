CPU Board:
ROMs need to be connected to A[19:1], not A[A20:2].
    * Cut A20 and replace with bodge to A1, then remap ROM data accordingly
ROM DQ[7:3] reversed when connecting to D[23:19] (currently connected to D[19:23])
Recommend routing /DBERR and /STATUS to jumper pins for easier debugging
* DIR is CORRECT polarity on data transceivers
Data transceivers /OE should be driven from PLD logic, not just BG
    * needs inputs from top address lines for data window plus FC and A16:19 for irq ack bus cycle
    * rename /CPU_SPACE to /IRQ_VEC_CS or something and connect U1.20 to address decoder U7.

IO Board:
Data buffer ~OE control should be AND of all CS signals on the board
    U16.19 to U10.21, add PLD output
XXX Data buffer DIR polarity is wrong - I was wrong about being wrong, R!W is correct!
    U16.1 to U10.23
DIR is wrong polarity on data transceivers
/INTVEC_Vx shouldn't be active low on the schematic as they're never inverted
It would be nice to control /1G and /2G on the IRQ decoder U11 from the IRQ logic PLD U15 using pin 23
    It would simplify the logic in some irq configurations I think and might make it easier to understand
The IRQ signal names aren't all accurate on the schematic 
    It looks like the DUARTs have an active low IRQ so these need to be barred on the schematic
    The RTC can be configured as high or low but defaults to high
    The VC82C42 refers to pins 34 and 35 as P24 and P25 but these are both active high
DUART IRQs both require pullups

DRAM board:
SIMM banks should be connected something like this for rank 2 SIMMs and remove J2:
    U1.RAS0     /RAS0       U2.RAS0     /RAS1
    U1.RAS1     /RAS2       U2.RAS1     /RAS3
    U1.RAS2     /RAS0       U2.RAS2     /RAS1
    U1.RAS3     /RAS2       U2.RAS3     /RAS3
Add jumper to enable RAS1, RAS3 and/or drive DP8422V B[1:0] from PLD
Suggest handling /CBREQ and /CBACK in CS PLD for burst accesses and drive /COLINC from same PLD

Video/16-bit board:
/OE on data transceivers is undriven. Route /OE to chip select logic PLD U6.23
RTL8019AS IOCS16B needs to be connected to 16-bit enable SIZ bit active low (SIZ0)
    x U5.14 to R12
It would be better to support single-byte accesses in addition to 2-byte accesses on this board,
    which means adding SIZ0 and SIZ1 to U10 (ACK logic). Some drivers expect to be able to make
    8-bit accesses.
    x U5.14 and U5.13 to U10.6 and U10.7 respectively
    * U10.20 (new /B_DSACK0) to BIGCON1.25
    It's not clear whether this is actually needed or if all 16-bit accesses are treated as 8-bit accesses internally
Address /OE isn't driven. Tie to ground or use 74F245s to support DMA mastering if the RTL8019AS is capable

Nice to haves:
    /CSIO from U6 to U10 to qualify /DSACK
    BUS_CLK on U10.1 for /STERM generation
    Drive INTVEC_V1 and V2 from U12 in addition to just V0

TODO:
Wish list of test pins for each board for debug headers

Rework:
cut U1.34, /RAS2_SLOTA
cut U1.45, /RAS1 (R13)
cut U1.33, /RAS3_SLOTA
connect U1.34 to U1.44, /RAS0
connect U1.45 to J2.5, /RAS2_SLOTA
connect U1.33 to U1.45

cut U2.44, /RAS2_SLOTB
connect U2.44 to R13, /RAS1
connect U2.34 (NC) to U2.44
connect U2.33 (NC) to U2.45

I would tie any unconnected address lines (A11, A12 on SIMMs) to ground.
I recommend renaming /ENCASx to /ENBANKx to clarify that these are not the same
    as /ECASx on the DP8422V
DRAM source termination lines should be placed as close to DP8422V as possible
DIR is wrong polarity on data transceivers
SCH: R21 and R22 should be 10k, not 10 ohms (board is populated correctly)
