IO Board:
Data buffer ~OE control should be AND of all CS signals on the board
    U16.19 to U10.21, add PLD output
XXX Data buffer DIR polarity is wrong - I was wrong about being wrong, R!W is correct!
    U16.1 to U10.23

OK READ r!w = 1
cpu -> xcvr -> bus -> xcvr -> io
       dir=1          dir=0

OK WRITE r!w = 0
cpu -> xcvr -> bus -> xcvr -> io
       dir=0          dir=1
